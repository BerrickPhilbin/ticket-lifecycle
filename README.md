<h2>📝 Stage 1: Intake & Assignment</h2>

This is the beginning of the lifecycle of a ticket. Once a ticket has been created, administrators or leads can review incoming requests and assign them to the most appropriate team member. Some employees may have more experience with certain types of issues than others, making proper assignment important.

<h2>📝 Stage 2: Working the Issue</h2>

This stage represents the main body of the ticket lifecycle. Operators and support staff work the issue, communicate with users, gather necessary information, and perform troubleshooting needed to resolve the problem.

<h2>📝 Stage 3: Resolution & Closure</h2>

This is the final stage of the lifecycle. When the operator has finished working the ticket and the issue is resolved, the ticket is closed — making the technician available for the next incoming assignment.
